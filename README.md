## Introduction to JS
The majority of modern websites uses JS, and all modern web browsers making it most ubiquitous programming language. In short, JS is high level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language that is suited to both object oriented and functional paradigm as well. JS was first used for scripting but, in recent decades it has evolved much more.

The name "JavaScript" is misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblence, JavaScript is completely different from Java programming language. And JavaScript has since long outgrown its scripting language to become a robust and efficient programming language. The latest version of language defines new features for serious large scale software development.

The core JavaScript language defines minimal API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions but does not include any input or output functionality. Input and output (and more features like storage, networking, graphics) are the responsibility of host environment in which JavaScript is embedded.

## Core JS
### Lexical structure
The lexical structure is a set of elementary rules specifying construct of programming language. It is lowest level syntax of a language. It specifies things like variable naming, delimiter characters, comments, statements and etc.

#### Character Set
JavaScript is written using Unicode character set. Unicode is superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written language.

- Case sensitivity
  - JavaScript is case sensitive language i.e "Apple" and "apple" are two different interpreted literals.
  - Keywords, variables, function names and other identifiers should be written consistently.
- Comments
  - JavaScript supports two styles of comments i.e. Single line comment and Multiline comment.
  - Single Line comment starts with // and all the text followed in the line is ignored by interpreter.
  - Any text between /* and */ is treated as multiline comment.
- Identifiers and Reserved words
  - JavaScript identifiers must begin with a letter, digits, underscore or a dollar sign($) followed by letters, digits, underscore or dollar signs.
  - Digits are not allowed as first character so that JavaScript can easily distinguish between identifiers and numbers.
  - Reserved words are as follows
    - break, delete, function, return, typeof, case, do, while, if , switch, var, catch, else, in, this, void,  continue, false, instanceof, throw, debugger, finally, new, true, with, default, for, null, try, class, const, enum, export, extends, import, super and more
  - Global variables and functions are as follows
    - arguments, Array, Boolean, Date, decodeURI, decodeURIComponent, encodeURI, encodeURIComponent, Error, eval, EvalError, Function, Infinity, isFinite, isNaN, JSON, Math, NaN, Number, Object, parseFloat, parseInt, RangeError, ReferenceError, RegExp, String, SyntaxError, TypeError, undefined, URIError
- Optional Semicolons;
  - JavaScript uses semicolons(;) to separate statements. But, you can omit the use of semicolon if the statements are written on separate lines.
  - You can omit the semicolon at the end of program or if the next token in the program is a closing brace(})

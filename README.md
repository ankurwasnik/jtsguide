## Introduction to JS
The majority of modern websites uses JS, and all modern web browsers making it most ubiquitous programming language. In short, JS is high level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language that is suited to both object oriented and functional paradigm as well. JS was first used for scripting but, in recent decades it has evolved much more.

The name "JavaScript" is misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblence, JavaScript is completely different from Java programming language.. And JavaScript has since long outgrown its scripting language to become a robust and efficient programming language. The latest version of language defines new features for serious large-scale software development.

The core JavaScript language defines minimal API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions but does not include any input or output functionality. Input and output (and more features like storage, networking, graphics) are the responsibility of host environment in which JavaScript is embedded.
